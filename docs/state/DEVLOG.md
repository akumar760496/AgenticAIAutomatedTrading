# DEVLOG — append-only record of what happened and why

One entry per session that changed something. Newest at the **bottom**, so `tail` gets the
recent past cheaply.

**What belongs here:** decisions a future session would otherwise re-litigate, surprises,
rejected alternatives, and anything that contradicts a plan doc.
**What does not:** what the code does (read the code), routine progress (that's `STATE.md`),
or bugs (that's `ISSUES.md`).

Entry format — keep it to five lines or fewer:

```markdown
## 2026-11-03 · Step 1.3
- **Built:** tick→bar aggregation, reconnect with gap rows
- **Decision:** gaps are recorded, never interpolated. Interpolated bars would make the
  volume gate silently wrong and the backtest optimistic.
- **Surprised by:** Dhan sends a snapshot tick on subscribe; it must not count as volume.
- **Rejected:** storing bars only, no ticks. Ticks are needed to debug the volume gate.
- **Follow-up:** ISS-012
```

### Rollup policy

At the end of each month, add a `## Rollup — <month>` entry summarising that month in ≤10
lines, and move the month's individual entries to `DEVLOG-ARCHIVE.md`. The live file stays
short; the archive stays greppable. Without this, the file that was meant to save tokens
becomes the thing that costs them.

## 2026-10-14 · Planning
- **Built:** docs 00–12 — flow, architecture, agents, roadmap, inputs, realities, v1 scope,
  stop criteria, requirements, plain-English features, build plan, interfaces/orders,
  verification.
- **Decision:** v1 is a research briefing with no order path. The earlier framing treated
  the briefing as a stepping stone; that was backwards — it is the product.
- **Decision:** proposals cannot structurally express a position size. This is the single
  constraint the rest of the architecture exists to protect.
- **Surprised by:** Bank Nifty weekly expiry is withdrawn (monthly only) and lot sizes
  changed with the Jan 2026 series. Writing the setups from memory would have specified a
  contract that does not exist.
- **Follow-up:** IV-rank gating created a bootstrapping problem — no IV history exists and
  it cannot be backfilled. Snapshotter is now the first action of Phase 1.

## 2026-10-15 · Dev workflow
- **Built:** `CLAUDE.md`, five skills in `.claude/skills/`, `docs/state/` (STATE, DEVLOG,
  ISSUES), `docs/13-dev-workflow.md`.
- **Decision:** split the requested single dynamic `skills.md` into a small stable
  `CLAUDE.md` + on-demand skills + rewritten-in-place state files. One growing file would
  be re-sent in full on every request and would defeat its own token goal.
- **Decision:** `STATE.md` is rewritten, `DEVLOG.md` is appended with monthly rollups. An
  unbounded append-only context file is a slow leak.

## 2026-10-15 · Code style
- **Built:** `docs/14-code-style.md`; §4b added to `CLAUDE.md`; `build-step` skill now
  points at it during implementation.
- **Decision:** target reader for all code is an intermediate Python developer with no
  context. Boring beats clever, and the risk gate gets the most boring version available
  because it is read under pressure during an incident.
- **Decision:** complexity is earned in exactly three places — the async market-data
  adapter, hypothesis property tests on the risk gate, and the LangGraph graph. Outside
  those, sophistication is a smell.
- **Rejected:** a lambda/registry pattern for the setup gates. Compact, but returns bare
  booleans, is not unit-testable per gate, and gives a dict key instead of a stack trace.

## 2026-10-15 · Steps 0.1 + 0.2
- **Built:** repo scaffold — Python 3.12 pinned, ruff/mypy-strict/pytest/hypothesis/
  pre-commit/detect-secrets, 7 layer packages with docstrings, `make check`, the verify
  harness (`make verify STEP=0_1`), CI workflow, `.importlinter` with 4 contracts.
- **Decision:** 0.2 was built in the same session as 0.1, because `make check` calls
  `lint-imports` — shipping 0.1 alone would have meant committing a gate that could not run.
- **Decision:** the `domain-is-pure` contract forbids `time` and `datetime` too, not just
  I/O libraries. Stricter than the plan text, and consistent with rule 5 (domain takes
  timestamps as arguments). Consequence: domain modules needing `datetime` for annotations
  must import it under `if TYPE_CHECKING:`. Step 0.4 will hit this first.
- **Surprised by:** ruff's default rule set flagged two things worth fixing rather than
  silencing — a magic number in the verify runner and a function-local import in a test.
  Both fixed properly; no `noqa` added.
- **Rejected:** `PLR0913` (too many arguments) stays ignored project-wide. Gate functions
  take explicit values rather than a context object on purpose (docs/14 section 2), and
  that rule fights the house style directly.

## 2026-10-15 · Package rename
- **Built:** `src/ativa` → `src/trading_desk` across the repo: package tree, `.importlinter`
  contracts, `pyproject.toml`, verify script, scaffold test, `VERIFICATION.md`, `docs/01`,
  `docs/04`, `STATE.md`.
- **Decision:** `trading_desk` over `research_desk`. A trading desk does research *and*
  executes, so the name still fits once v2 places orders — `research_desk` would have felt
  wrong the day the order path landed.
- **Decision:** distribution name is `trading-desk` (hyphen, PEP 508 convention), import
  package is `trading_desk` (underscore). Different on purpose, not an inconsistency.
- **Note:** done now rather than later on purpose — the rename touched 8 files today and
  would have touched every module written after it.

## 2026-10-15 · Step 0.3
- **Built:** `infra/config.py` (settings split by concern, SecretStr, fail-fast naming the
  missing env vars), `infra/logging.py` (redaction filter), `.env.example`, 10 tests,
  `scripts/verify/step_0_3.py`.
- **Decision:** settings are split into Dhan / LLM / Telegram / Infra / App rather than one
  object. A phased build needs Dhan credentials months before an Anthropic key exists, and
  one object would force every key present from day one.
- **Decision:** loaders take an explicit `env_file` parameter. Needed because pydantic
  evaluates `model_config` at class-definition time, so patching a module constant in a
  test does nothing.
- **Surprised by:** a test silently read the real `.env` once it was populated — it passed
  for the wrong reason while the file was empty. Fixed with the parameter plus a
  `conftest.py` autouse fixture stripping the five real credential variables from every
  test. This is the class of bug that only appears after credentials arrive.
- **Rejected:** having the redaction filter drop records containing secrets. Dropping the
  line hides the event as well as the secret; rewriting keeps the event.

## 2026-10-15 · Step 0.4
- **Built:** `domain/values.py` (Money, Price, Quantity, Percent), `domain/enums.py`,
  `domain/instruments.py`, `ports/clock.py`, `adapters/clock.py`, `tests/fakes/clock.py`,
  `tests/domain/test_domain_is_pure.py`, 39 tests, `scripts/verify/step_0_4.py`.
- **Decision — architecture change.** The `domain-is-pure` import contract no longer bans
  `datetime`. It banned a *type* when the real rule is that domain never *reads* a clock:
  an option expiry is a `date`, and `InstrumentRef` cannot express one without it. The
  alternative was `if TYPE_CHECKING` imports throughout, which breaks for any runtime-
  validated model (step 2.1's Pydantic contracts) and makes the code harder to read for
  no safety gain. Two compensating controls, both stricter than the import ban:
  `tests/domain/test_domain_is_pure.py` scans every domain module for clock calls
  (catching `date.today()`, which the import ban never did), and the step 0.4 verify
  check scans `src/` for `datetime.now(` outside the clock adapter. Both were induced and
  witnessed. **Reversible — say so and the ban comes back with TYPE_CHECKING imports.**
- **Decision:** `Money` and `Price` are separate types even though both hold paise. A
  price is per unit, money is an amount, and `Price.times(Quantity) -> Money` is the only
  bridge. Confusing the two is how a position gets sized at one contract's premium.
- **Decision:** rounding is ROUND_HALF_UP, not Python's default bankers' rounding. For
  money, 0.005 rounding to 0.00 surprises people, and surprise in sizing code is expensive.
- **Surprised by:** the verify check for stray clock calls produced two false positives —
  a compiled `.pyc`, and prose in a docstring that wrote the call literally. Fixed by
  scanning `.py` files in Python rather than shelling out to `grep`, whose
  directory-exclusion flags differ between BSD and GNU. A check that cries wolf gets
  ignored, which is worse than no check.
- **Rejected:** storing `Percent` as a fraction. Every threshold in docs/06 is written in
  percent, and converting at the boundary is where scale errors come from.

## 2026-10-15 · Step 0.5
- **Built:** `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres with TimescaleDB + pgvector, Redis), alembic
  scaffolding and the 0001 baseline migration, `infra/db.py`, five `make db-*` targets,
  `scripts/verify/step_0_5.py`.
- **Decision:** one Postgres with both extensions, not separate databases. Bars, news,
  journal and agent memory can then be joined, and there is one backup and one restore
  drill rather than three.
- **Decision:** the database URL is read from `.env` by `alembic/env.py` rather than
  written into `alembic.ini`. A tracked config file should never be able to hold a
  credential.
- **Decision:** `downgrade()` on the baseline is a deliberate no-op. Dropping the
  timescaledb extension would destroy every hypertable in the database - not a reasonable
  response to rolling back one migration. `make db-reset` is the dev path to clean.
- **Decision:** Redis runs with persistence off, and the verify script asserts it. Redis
  is transport; durable state belongs in Postgres. If something important ends up in
  Redis, that failing check is the signal.
- **Decision:** migrations are hand-written, `target_metadata = None`, no autogenerate.
  Autogenerate does not understand hypertables, and a time-series schema written by hand
  is clearer than one diffed from models.
- **Known gap:** `make check` does not start Docker, so CI cannot catch a broken compose
  file. Only `make verify STEP=0_5` exercises infrastructure. Acceptable while the stack
  is two containers.
